When I first assembled my Jog2K, I hard some trouble assembling the buttons. And they didn’t look 
great. I decided to modify the two part buttons that were black and white in order to simplify the 
assembly process and provide greater contrast.
The existing versions were modified to produce a single part button with icons that are wide enough to 
color using a black Ultra Fine Point Sharpie for added contrast.
I later decided that the same process would work on the top case cover to improve legibility of the 
“Spindle Override” and “Feed Override” text. I didn’t modify the cover, just printed it in a light color. 
This part of the mod is a bit difficult since the lettering is only about .7mm wide and the sharpie is about 
1mm wide, but it will squeeze in if you take your time.
 
Instructions:
1)	Print the case top in white (or some other light color). Use a dark Ultra Fine Point Sharpie to 
color in the text. For extra credit, you could modify the text to be a bit wider which would make 
the coloring easier.
2)	You no longer need to print any of the white buttons in the Deluxe version’s White button 
folder. In the black FDM buttons floder, you also don’t need to print the black keycaps for the 
Flood Button Cover, the Fn Button Cover, the Mist Button Cover, the two Minus Button Covers, 
the two Plus Button Covers, and the two Reset Button Covers.
3)	Print and use the 9 button covers in this folder. Use a dark Ultra Fine Point Sharpie to color in 
the icons.
