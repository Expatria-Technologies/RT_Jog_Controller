# Jog2k Deluxe Enclosure

![](./Images/Jog2k_Enclosure_2.png)

A more involved build for the Jog2K enclosure.

### Buttons
Buttons are designed for MSLA printing, and are assembled from 2 parts. The 'lightpipe' or 'core', and the 'cover'. Cores should be printed in white, lightpipes in translucent, and covers in black. There is a small amount of clearance designed in to the parts to allow for slight differences in resin tuning. Button pieces can be glued together with a small amount of CA glue if needed. 

### Enclsoure
The enclosure is designed to be FDM/FFF printed with a standard 0.4mm nozzle in PLA. Print tolerances are somewhat critical here to avoid excess rotational slop in the buttons; ensure your extrusion multiplier is well tuned for your filament. Materials other than PLA may require compensation for shrinkage. 

The top cover prints best with a single perimeter on the bottom layer; the text gets a bit difficult otherwise. There is a checkbox for this in SuperSlicer - Under Quality --> Only One Perimieter check the 'On First Layer' box. 

There is a recess in the rear of the enclosure for a window in the same shape as the standard enclosure. It can be cut from acrylic and glued in from the rear, with the lip hiding any glue residue. 

Holes for the fasteners that secure the lid are designed to accept heatset inserts of the Voron typical variety. The board is secured with self-tapping screws, as it is likely to be removed less often and it allows for more wiggle room for print tolerances.


### Hardware Required
- 4x - M3 heatset inserts - 3 x 4 x 5mm - https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005003286574326.html
- 4x - M3 x 16mm flat head screws  - https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32965177647.html
- 7x - M2.6 x 8mm self tapping screws - https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32970730241.html



### Assembly
- Trim/deburr/clean up printed enclosure halves.
- Install heat set inserts into the bottom half of the enclosure.
- Insert buttons and lightpipes. Lightpipes are a fairly tight press fit. Some trimming of the holes may be required if the fit is too tight.
- Align the screen and either heat-stake the plastic mounting pins or use the support bracket.
- Connect screen to PCB via short wires or cable.
- Align PCB with holes/captures
- Insert M2.6 x 8mm self tapping screws and tighten
- Flip cover over and ensure all buttons are operational. If any are stuck, loosen screws on PCB and adjust alignmnent slightly
- Insert assembled top cover into back enclosure
- Insert M3 x 16mm flat head screws and tighten

### Notes
- Pretty much any resin type will work. Success has been had with Elegoo Standard, Siraya Tech Fast, and Eryone ABS-like.
The resin buttons may warp slightly at the base as the resin shrinks. The clearances of the cover have been designed such that any warping here shouldn't cause a problem.
- Print the black resin parts last. The resin will shrink in the first day or so after printing, and it will be easier to get them on if the other parts have shrunk a bit first. If print settings are well tuned, the black covers will fit tightly enough after shrinking that they will stay put on their own. 
- Likewise, the buttons may fit too tightly in the enclosure right after printing. They will loosen up a bit after a day or so of resting, when they are at final dimension.
- A tapered reamer of the type typically used for RC car bodyshells is an ideal tool for cleaning up first layer 'squish' in round holes or fine tuning the lightpipe holes. - https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005003460682946.html They're usually available on Amazon for about $10 too.
